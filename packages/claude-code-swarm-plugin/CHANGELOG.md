## 0.63.4

### Patch Changes

- [`02c3ae9`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/02c3ae904ec3207feb75b58284bc6e8097c5aafd) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix(mcp): coerce string→array params flattened by MCP protocol

  The MCP protocol flattens all `type: "array"` JSON Schema params to `type: "string"`,
  causing Claude to send JSON-encoded strings or pipe-delimited strings instead of actual
  arrays. This broke `hive_create_epic` (subtasks), `swarmmail_reserve` (paths), and 8
  other array params.

  Adds `coerceArrayParams()` that handles JSON strings, pipe-delimited, comma-separated,
  and single values. Relaxes Zod validation to accept both strings and arrays for these
  params.

## 0.63.3

### Patch Changes

- [`f21f581`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/f21f581c2efeb1407ae2761bfb2f4a641714e212) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - chore: link plugin versions — sync claude-code-swarm-plugin with opencode-swarm-plugin

## 0.61.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: improve swarm tool schemas and documentation

  - Fix MCP array parameter schemas (files, paths, to, files_touched, etc.) - use proper JSON Schema array types instead of string with "JSON array" description
  - Add explicit spawning examples to swarm-coordination skills showing correct swarm_spawn_subtask format
  - Add ready_for_review status to ralph story schema for proper review workflow
  - Fix skill frontmatter to use only name and description fields per skill-creator spec
  - Remove release skill from plugin distribution (project-specific only)

## 0.60.2

### Patch Changes

- [`453fe90`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/453fe9063070a483dc64bfaabbf99362c8674e48) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix(versions): sync all plugin.json manifests via changesets lifecycle hook

  plugin.json files were never updated by changesets, causing version drift:

  - opencode-swarm-plugin plugin.json stuck at 0.59.5 (package.json: 0.62.0)
  - claude-code-swarm-plugin plugin.json stuck at 0.59.6 (package.json: 0.60.0)
  - marketplace.json stuck at 0.57.5

  **Updated `sync-plugin-versions.ts`** to sync all three manifests:

  - opencode-swarm-plugin/claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
  - claude-code-swarm-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
  - .claude-plugin/marketplace.json

  **Added `version` lifecycle hook** to claude-code-swarm-plugin/package.json
  pointing to the shared sync script so changesets bumping either package
  triggers a full sync.

### Patch Changes

- [`552ca1a`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/552ca1a4a077bd4f61b0f3568ccf82d01d27bc13) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix(hooks): restore swarm claude subcommand tree deleted by 86fab13

  Commit 86fab13 ("support multiple OpenCode installation methods") accidentally
  deleted ~2,070 lines from bin/swarm.ts via a bad rebase, nuking the entire
  `swarm claude` subcommand tree. Every Claude Code hook invocation has been
  hitting "Unknown subcommand" since, most visibly `agent-stop` on every response.

  **Restored from 70d47d5:**

  - `case "claude"` in main CLI switch
  - ClaudeHookInput interface + 3 helper functions (readHookInput,
    resolveClaudeProjectPath, writeClaudeHookOutput)
  - 10 handler functions: session-start, user-prompt, pre-compact, session-end,
    pre-edit, pre-complete, post-complete, track-tool, compliance, skill-reload
  - Claude admin commands: path, install, uninstall, init
  - Required imports: createMemoryAdapter, invalidateSkillsCache, discoverSkills

  **New stub handlers for ed31f5c hooks:**

  - coordinator-start, worker-start (SubagentStart)
  - subagent-stop (SubagentStop), agent-stop (Stop)
  - track-task (PreToolUse:TaskCreate|TaskUpdate)
  - post-task-update (PostToolUse:TaskUpdate)

  **Synced hooks.json** in opencode-swarm-plugin/claude-plugin to include
  SubagentStart, SubagentStop, Stop, and task tracking hooks matching
  the claude-code-swarm-plugin version.

### Minor Changes

- [#163](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/pull/163) [`ed31f5c`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ed31f5c316e1bb9137bb27e824f2fc58b9ba9d46) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - feat(plugin): upgrade for Claude Code 2.1.32 native integration

  Add dual-mode architecture supporting both native agent teams and task
  fallback. Plugin now complements rather than duplicates native features.

  **claude-code-swarm-plugin:**

  - agents: Add permissionMode, memory, disallowedTools, lifecycle hooks
  - swarm.md: Full rewrite with environment detection, mode-aware protocols
  - hooks: Add SubagentStart/Stop, TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tracking
  - skills: Update for TaskCreate/TaskUpdate, TeammateTool awareness
  - README: Add 2.1.32 integration docs, architecture diagram, comparison table

  **opencode-swarm-plugin:**

  - Fix test schema mismatch: add access_count, last_accessed, category, status
  - Fix decay_factor default from 0.7 to 1.0 to match Drizzle schema
  - Update column count assertions (14 → 18 columns)

  Native teams provide: real-time messaging, planning mode, task UI
  Plugin provides: git-backed persistence, semantic memory, file locking

### Patch Changes

- [`3bbf31d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/3bbf31d73874d49c319f4b89f51934ae9049622d) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix(mcp): inline tool schemas to fix params arriving as undefined

  The MCP server scraped tool definitions from `swarm tool --list --json` at
  startup, but the CLI's `--list` handler never supported `--json`. The fallback
  parsed colored text output and registered every tool with an empty JSON schema
  (`properties: {}`), which converted to a Zod schema with no required fields.
  The MCP SDK then treated all params as optional, delivering `undefined` to
  every handler.

  - **claude-code-swarm-plugin**: Replace runtime CLI scraping with static
    `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` array containing all 25 tools with proper JSON schemas
    (properties, required fields, types, descriptions)
  - **swarm-tools**: Export `SWARM_TOOLS` from index.ts; MCP server imports
    canonical definitions instead of scraping CLI
  - Remove dead `getToolDefinitions()`, `filterTools()`, unused `execSync` import

- [`ef6d21d`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/ef6d21de5ae445bb5070f279e5559f1d2499eb49) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - fix(decompose): handle object and double-stringified response in swarm_validate_decomposition

  MCP server may pass response as already-parsed object (not string) when Claude provides the decomposition. Now handles both string and object inputs, plus the edge case of double-stringified JSON.

### Minor Changes

- [`8ea6ce7`](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools/commit/8ea6ce760256951d83985eb6871b99b5f6e6083d) Thanks [@joelhooks](https://github.com/joelhooks)! - ## Initial Release: Claude Code Swarm Plugin

  Lightweight Claude Code plugin that delegates to the globally installed `swarm` CLI.

  **Why a separate package:**

  - The main `opencode-swarm-plugin` bundles native dependencies (`@libsql/client`) that cause issues when Claude Code copies plugins to its cache
  - This thin wrapper (~600KB) shells out to the CLI, avoiding native module problems

  **Includes:**

  - MCP server with 25 tools (hive, hivemind, swarmmail, swarm orchestration)
  - Slash commands: `/swarm`, `/hive`, `/inbox`, `/status`, `/handoff`
  - Skills: `always-on-guidance`, `swarm-coordination`
  - Agents: `coordinator`, `worker`, `background-worker`
  - Lifecycle hooks for session management

  **Prerequisites:**
  Install the swarm CLI globally: `npm install -g opencode-swarm-plugin`
